# Refactored Portfolio

## Goals:

- Create a new portfolio which uses react and other frameworks.
- Refactor previous portfolio to reflect the information I've learned since its initial creation.

Though the initial portfolio we created was not meant to be created in such a way, I accidentally created something that resembled react in the beginning of class. This whole application uses one page and renders/derenders elements based on CSS exclusively. Thats not to say that React does anything so mundane, rather I'm just proud of the fact that I was able to identify one of the issues that react solves, and pseudo-solve it myself.
